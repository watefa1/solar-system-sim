# ðŸŒŒ Solar System Simulator

An interactive 3D Solar System simulator built with **React** and **React Three Fiber**.  
Explore the Sun and planets with a free camera and animated orbits.

## Technologies

- **React** â€“ Declarative UI  
- **React Three Fiber** â€“ Three.js integration in React  
- **Three.js** â€“ 3D rendering engine  
- **Drei** â€“ Helpers for controls, lights, and more  
- **Vite** â€“ Fast bundler for development

## Features

- Rotating Sun with emissive light  
- Planets with distinct orbits and speeds  
- Interactive orbital camera (rotate, zoom)  
- Gradient space background for depth effect  
- Easily extendable: add planets, rings, or textures
